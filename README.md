# Aerolense: <i> Military Aircraft Detection Using Deep Learning Model </i>

## By using DeepLearning (<code>YOLO</code>) we try to automate the **Tracking** and **Targeting** of military aircraft and control weapon system to target the threat automatically based on instructions from Aerolense

## This project is made using python 3.10 and torch cuda 12.4 though it can also work with only cpu version of torch but it can be slow.

## Pip install 
### for only cpu version
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements-cpu.txt
```
### for only GPU CUDA version
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements-cuda.txt
```
